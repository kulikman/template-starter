## Decisions

### 2026-04 — Stack Pinning to Next.js 16
**Context:** Project created from template-starter
**Decision:** Next.js 16 App Router + React 19.2 + Supabase + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui v4 + Vercel
**Alternatives Considered:** Remix (less ecosystem), Prisma (redundant with Supabase types), Next.js 14/15 (EOL path)
**Consequences:** All data fetching in Server Components by default; `proxy.ts` replaces `middleware.ts`; `"use cache"` for opt-in caching; Edge Functions for sensitive ops
